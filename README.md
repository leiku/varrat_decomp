## Introduction

This repository provides the workflow that resulted in all the results for the manuscript. The latex for the supporting information of the manuscript is also included. 

## Running the workflow

See 'master.R' for the workflow. Run it with your R working directory set to directory it
is in. Then see the XXX (DAN add info about compiling the sup mat).

## Dependencies for master.R



## Dependencies for XXX


## Additional dependencies?

If you find additional dependencies were needed on your system, please let us know: 
lei.zhao@cau.edu.cn, reuman@ku.edu. The code was run by Reuman on Ubuntu 16.04 
using R version 3.4.4 and pdflatex; and by Zhao on Windows 10 using R version 3.5.1 and MikTex 2.9. 
It has not been tested on Mac. We have endeavored to list all dependencies we can 
think of above, but we have only run the codes on our own machines, so we cannot 
guarantee that additional dependencies will not also be needed on other machines. 
This repository is intended to record a workflow, and is not designed or tested 
for distribution and wide use on multiple machines. It is not guaranteed to work 
on the first try without any hand-holding on arbitrary computing setups.

## Intermediate files:

Compiling the latex automatically produces a lot of 'intermediate' files. Some of these 
can be useful for diagnosing problems, if any.
